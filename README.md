 Diabetes Inference Project
📌 Description
Predicting diabetes risk using health data and statistical inference.

📊 Features
Analyzes medical data to determine diabetes likelihood

Uses key health indicators like glucose, BMI, age, insulin, and blood pressure

Provides data-driven insights for early diagnosis

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (or R, if applicable)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)

Statistical methods (e.g., hypothesis testing, correlation, regression)

📂 Dataset
Source: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (or mention your dataset source)

Attributes: Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin, Blood Pressure, Outcome, etc.

🔍 Inference Outcome
Identified strong predictors of diabetes

Statistical results support early detection based on patterns in medical data

💡 Future Scope
Integrate with healthcare systems like Medilocker

Improve accuracy using machine learning models

Add user interface for easy input and report generation
